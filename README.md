Current/Emerging trends in CS

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
In this project, I created and implemented a Deep-Q learning network. This Artificial Neural Network (ANN) uses experience replay and reinforcement learning (RL) to train the model to find an efficicent path through a maze. 

Some starter code was supplied by the professor. This included environment setup, model foundation, and initializing variables. I created the functions and code to implement and train the model. It took many tries, experimenting with exploration and loss values before the model was properly trained. 

# Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create programs to solve real-world and theoretical problems. These applications store, transfer, manipulate, and display data. This can be something as simple as a calendar application or as complex as an AI model solving complex theoretical problems. Whether simple or complex, these applications can increase productivity, increase our understanding of the world, or simply provide entertainment. 

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When evaluating a problem for solving, the following approach is the one I use:
  - Study the current problem
      - What is the overall problem?
      - Is there currently a solution?
      - Is the solution effective?
      - What are the current pain points?
      - What are the inputs and outputs of the process?
  - Identify all data input or output
  - Conduct stakeholder interviews
  - Brainstorm solutions
  - Research possible solutions for pros & cons of each
  - Present best solution to stakeholders
  - Implement feedback from stakeholders in plan
  - Implement solution using the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
As a developer, it is crucial to maintain high ethical standards. For the user, it's important to recognize and safeguard against biases. As a developer, we must make sure biases do not get unintentionally incorporated into our programs. These biases have the capability of causing harm to users and organizations. Organizations must also be considered during development. Unethical development patterns can cause legal complications for companies, leak user data, or negatively affect the organization's reputation.
